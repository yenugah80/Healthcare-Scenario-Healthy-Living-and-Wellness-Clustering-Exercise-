# Healthcare-Scenario-Healthy-Living-and-Wellness-Clustering-Exercise-

Scenario Overview:

In todayâ€™s world, healthy living and wellness have become major focus areas in healthcare. As data analysts, you are tasked with helping a healthcare organization analyze trends in patient wellness to improve their healthy living programs. The organization has provided you with a simulated dataset that includes information such as exercise frequency, diet quality, sleep duration, stress levels, and BMI (Body Mass Index) for a population of patients. Your goal is to segment the patients into distinct clusters to better understand their wellness profiles and identify opportunities for targeted health interventions.

Task Instructions:

Dataset Creation:

Provided is a simulated dataset with various health and wellness indicators (e.g., daily exercise time, number of healthy meals per day, hours of sleep per night, stress level score, BMI).
Use this dataset to perform clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Learning Objectives:

Clustering:
Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group patients with similar wellness profiles.
Analyze and interpret the results to understand different patient segments and their behaviors.
Dimensionality Reduction:
Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the dataset.
Evaluate how dimensionality reduction impacts the clustering results and interpret the PCA components.
Data Exploration:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the health and wellness data, using Python libraries like pandas, plotly, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Model Comparison:
Compare the effectiveness of clustering models before and after applying PCA.
Use key evaluation metrics to measure the success of the clustering (e.g., silhouette score, within-cluster sum of squares).
Submission Requirements:

Code: Push your Python code to a GitHub repository. Ensure that it includes:
Clustering model development.
PCA implementation for dimensionality reduction.
Visualizations that explain your findings (e.g., scatter plots of clusters, PCA components).
Presentation:
Create a presentation summarizing your approach, findings, and recommendations for improving the wellness program.
Present your results in class, focusing on how clustering could help the healthcare organization tailor wellness interventions for different patient segments.
Team Option:
You may choose to work in teams of up to 3 students or work individually.
Deliverables:

GitHub repository with your Python code and documentation.
A PDF of your presentation summarizing your findings and solutions.
Class presentation of your analysis.
Evaluation:

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accuracy and interpretation of clustering and dimensionality reduction results.
Creativity and thoroughness in data exploration and visualizations.
Quality of the presentation and clarity in communicating results.
Use of GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Note: Be sure to submit your GitHub repository link along with the presentation ahead of the class. This activity is an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning concepts to real-world healthcare challenges and work collaboratively to enhance your analytical and presentation skills.
